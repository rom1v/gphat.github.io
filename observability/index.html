<p>I've spent a large chunk of my career working with or on systems for collecting, visualing and monitoring the systems we build in software engineering and operations, so I'm working on building a lot of writing on the subject. I call it <a href="/observability/glossary.html#observability">observability</a> I hope you'll check it out!

<h2>My Writings</h2>

<h2>My Background</h2>
<p>In my early career I <a href="http://onemogin.com/observability/tech/let-the-rithm-move-you.html">wrote some custom observability systems</a>. Later I focused more specifically on <a href="http://onemogin.com/observability/charting/a-chart-is-worth-some-words.html">charting libraries</a>. At <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> I <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2013/observability-at-twitter">worked on and managed the Observability team</a>, which ran an in-house built system. Later, at <a href="http://keen.io">Keen IO</a> I inherited and extended the use of <a href="http://datadoghq.com">Datadog</a> to a holistic observability platform I was very proud of. Most recently at <a href="http://stripe.com">Stripe</a> I'm working each day to improve our observability! I've contributed to numerous projects in the space and continue to play with side project like <a href="http://gphat.github.io/clack/">client side charting libraries</a>.
