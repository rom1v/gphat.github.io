   This post is part of my writings on <a href="/observability">Observability</a>. I've spent a large chunk of my career working with or on systems for collecting, visualing and monitoring the systems we build in software engineering and operations, so I'm working on building a lot of writing on the subject. I hope you'll check it out!
